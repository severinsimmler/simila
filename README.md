# Simila

Fast computation of string similarities.

Simila is a modern Python library without third-party dependencies and a backend written in C. You can compute

* Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations

* string similarity

* approximate median strings, and generally string averaging

* string sequence and set similarity


You can install the latest stable version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/simila):

$ pip install simila
```


## Minimal working example
